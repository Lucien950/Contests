# Tabulation Recipe

------

- Visualize the problem as a table

  - As in `table[x][y]` is analogous to table(x, y)

- Size the table based on the inputs

- Initialize the table with default values

- Seed trivial answers into the table

- Iterate through the table, and fill further positions based on current position
